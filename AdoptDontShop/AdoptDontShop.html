            <h1>A phrase Worth Thousands of Lives</h1> <!--It actually is, adopting saves more than one pet-->
            <p>Have you ever heard of the phrase "Adopt Don't Shop?" Adopt Don't Shop is a campaign slogan that is used to promote adopting pets from shelters rather than breeders/puppy mills</p>     
             
            <br/>
             
             <h1>Why to Adopt</h1> <!--These are only some benefits to adopting--> <!--This also shows why adopting from puppy mills is wrong-->
             <p>Dogs from puupy mills and commercial-breeding facilities live in filthy conditions without adequate food, water or veterinary care. Practices and conditions in most puppy mills are unethical and downright despicable in many cases. Female dogs are bred at every opportunity with little to no recovery time between litters. By purchasing these dogs, the puppy mills and breeding facilities are only making more money to contiue their businesses.</p>
